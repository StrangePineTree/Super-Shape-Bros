#TODO for player:
#speed stat
#weight stat that effects how fast you fall, how high you jump, and KB/damage(?)
#acceleration stat
#FS(final shape) meter that charges when dealing damage

#variable for each type of attack (light, heavy, and special)
#attack cooldown for each kind of attack (^)
#damage
#lives (lives will = LIVES which is changed in main menu)
#amount of jumps left
#bool for if first jump on ground was used
#hit for if player was hit (takes away control from player until all velocity from attack has been applied(stops people from negating KB))
#player states for animation (one for every attack, being hit, jumping)
#left/right state for animation + attacks/movement maybe
